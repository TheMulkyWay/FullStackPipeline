# FullStackPipeline

With the me, myself and I approach I'm using several of my identities to simulate 3 different team 
members working at various stages.

Other ID's are available to any team member currently engaged in active projects working with me.

These ID's are used only as an academic reference as is the project.

Whilst Github is also a learning resource, code alone doesn't do the job.

CI CD isn't DRY, Continuous twice doesn't explain where the emphasis really is.

It's the Intergration and Delivery that are the two important terms, and of those the word Intergration is far more important
for understanding what CI CD really is for.

Integrating the work of two or more people so they each get the benefit of the others work in such a way that you don't overwrite anyone elses changes and they
don't overwrite yours. 

After all if its new to you there's a likelyhood that you'd be nervous and wouldn't
want to screw things up for the team; so "Safe integration" would be a better way of introducing new team memebers
who are also new to Github and Continuous Integration.

## Practice areas
Thats what these user Id's are used for, here and in other repositories e.g. github/John-Mulkearns and github/websitio
where you'll also find seperate (not forked) copies that are available for different scenarios

## Build Scenarios
As per normal any change to the repo (you can decide which branch) will trigger the build pipeline on Azure
